# A Fediverse writers webring

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/96b5fae3-743f-4a8e-948a-18ed75d25890/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/writers-webring/deploys)

Made using the [Webring Starter Kit](https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/).

The Fediverse has some good writers in it.
It's also anti- big-box community, a la Facebook, or Reddit, or Instagram, or even Myspace.
For me ([@acdw](https://writing.exchange/@acdw)), at least, it's related to the idea
that we should [own our data](https://indieweb.org/own_your_data), Indie-Web style.
To that end, many of us have our own websites,
and what better way to connect those websites than a webring?

That's what this is. A webring for writers in the Fediverse.
Do you write fiction, literary, fan-, or otherwise? 
Poetry, good or bad or baroque? 
How-to manuals, on any subject whatsoever?
Personal essays about love or loss or hair or what's going on in your daily life?
Investigative journalism, on anything from geopolitics to who ate the last cookie from the jar?
Anything at all!??!?

YOU ARE WELCOME.
