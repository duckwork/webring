    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a> of writers in and around the Fediverse.
        We came together after <a href="https://writing.exchange/@acdw">@acdw</a>'s toot suggesting it:
        <iframe src="https://writing.exchange/@acdw/102089022010896923/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://writing.exchange/embed.js" async="async"></script>
        He got the idea (and the code) 
        from <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.com/">this project</a> 
        by <a href="https://mxb.dev/">Max BÃ¶ck</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <h3>The easy way</h3>
    <p>
        If you don't have a Github account, you can also use this form to sign up.
        The webring admins will then look at your site and handle your request.
    </p>
    {% include 'signupform.njk' %}
    
    <h3>The tech-savvy way</h3>
    <p>
        To join the webring, <a href="{{ meta.repo }}/compare">open a pull request</a> 
        and supply the name and URL of your site. If you publish a RSS feed, you can provide that as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Add the banner</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've joined the ring, copy this code snippet into your site:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It will render this banner that links to the other members:
    </p>

    {% include 'snippet.njk' %}

    <h2>Want to host your own webring?</h2>
    <p>
